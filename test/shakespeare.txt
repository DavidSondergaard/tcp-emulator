     1	SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
     2	Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants
     3	THESEUS
     4	Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
     5	Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
     6	Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
     7	This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
     8	Like to a step-dame or a dowager
     9	Long withering out a young man revenue.
    10	HIPPOLYTA
    11	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
    12	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
    13	And then the moon, like to a silver bow
    14	New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
    15	Of our solemnities.
    16	THESEUS
    17	Go, Philostrate,
    18	Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
    19	Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
    20	Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
    21	The pale companion is not for our pomp.
    22	Exit PHILOSTRATE
    23	
    24	Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
    25	And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
    26	But I will wed thee in another key,
    27	With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
    28	Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS
    29	
    30	EGEUS
    31	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
    32	THESEUS
    33	Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
    34	EGEUS
    35	Full of vexation come I, with complaint
    36	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
    37	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
    38	This man hath my consent to marry her.
    39	Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
    40	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
    41	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
    42	And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
    43	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
    44	With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
    45	And stolen the impression of her fantasy
    46	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
    47	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
    48	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
    49	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
    50	Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
    51	To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
    52	Be it so she; will not here before your grace
    53	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
    54	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
    55	As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
    56	Which shall be either to this gentleman
    57	Or to her death, according to our law
    58	Immediately provided in that case.
    59	THESEUS
    60	What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
    61	To you your father should be as a god;
    62	One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
    63	To whom you are but as a form in wax
    64	By him imprinted and within his power
    65	To leave the figure or disfigure it.
    66	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
    67	HERMIA
    68	So is Lysander.
    69	THESEUS
    70	In himself he is;
    71	But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
    72	The other must be held the worthier.
    73	HERMIA
    74	I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
    75	THESEUS
    76	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
    77	HERMIA
    78	I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
    79	I know not by what power I am made bold,
    80	Nor how it may concern my modesty,
    81	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
    82	But I beseech your grace that I may know
    83	The worst that may befall me in this case,
    84	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
    85	THESEUS
    86	Either to die the death or to abjure
    87	For ever the society of men.
    88	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
    89	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
    90	Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
    91	You can endure the livery of a nun,
    92	For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
    93	To live a barren sister all your life,
    94	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
    95	Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
    96	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
    97	But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
    98	Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
    99	Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
   100	HERMIA
   101	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
   102	Ere I will my virgin patent up
   103	Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
   104	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
   105	THESEUS
   106	Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--
   107	The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
   108	For everlasting bond of fellowship--
   109	Upon that day either prepare to die
   110	For disobedience to your father's will,
   111	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
   112	Or on Diana's altar to protest
   113	For aye austerity and single life.
   114	DEMETRIUS
   115	Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
   116	Thy crazed title to my certain right.
   117	LYSANDER
   118	You have her father's love, Demetrius;
   119	Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
   120	EGEUS
   121	Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
   122	And what is mine my love shall render him.
   123	And she is mine, and all my right of her
   124	I do estate unto Demetrius.
   125	LYSANDER
   126	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
   127	As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
   128	My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
   129	If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
   130	And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
   131	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
   132	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
   133	Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
   134	Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
   135	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
   136	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
   137	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
   138	THESEUS
   139	I must confess that I have heard so much,
   140	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
   141	But, being over-full of self-affairs,
   142	My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
   143	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
   144	I have some private schooling for you both.
   145	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
   146	To fit your fancies to your father's will;
   147	Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
   148	Which by no means we may extenuate--
   149	To death, or to a vow of single life.
   150	Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
   151	Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
   152	I must employ you in some business
   153	Against our nuptial and confer with you
   154	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
   155	EGEUS
   156	With duty and desire we follow you.
   157	Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
   158	
   159	LYSANDER
   160	How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
   161	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
   162	HERMIA
   163	Belike for want of rain, which I could well
   164	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
   165	LYSANDER
   166	Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
   167	Could ever hear by tale or history,
   168	The course of true love never did run smooth;
   169	But, either it was different in blood,--
   170	HERMIA
   171	O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
   172	LYSANDER
   173	Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
   174	HERMIA
   175	O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
   176	LYSANDER
   177	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
   178	HERMIA
   179	O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
   180	LYSANDER
   181	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
   182	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
   183	Making it momentany as a sound,
   184	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
   185	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
   186	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
   187	And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
   188	The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
   189	So quick bright things come to confusion.
   190	HERMIA
   191	If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
   192	It stands as an edict in destiny:
   193	Then let us teach our trial patience,
   194	Because it is a customary cross,
   195	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
   196	Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
   197	LYSANDER
   198	A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
   199	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
   200	Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
   201	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
   202	And she respects me as her only son.
   203	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
   204	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
   205	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
   206	Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
   207	And in the wood, a league without the town,
   208	Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
   209	To do observance to a morn of May,
   210	There will I stay for thee.
   211	HERMIA
   212	My good Lysander!
   213	I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
   214	By his best arrow with the golden head,
   215	By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
   216	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
   217	And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
   218	When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
   219	By all the vows that ever men have broke,
   220	In number more than ever women spoke,
   221	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
   222	To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
   223	LYSANDER
   224	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
   225	Enter HELENA
   226	
   227	HERMIA
   228	God speed fair Helena! whither away?
   229	HELENA
   230	Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
   231	Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
   232	Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
   233	More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
   234	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
   235	Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
   236	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
   237	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
   238	My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
   239	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
   240	The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
   241	O, teach me how you look, and with what art
   242	You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
   243	HERMIA
   244	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
   245	HELENA
   246	O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
   247	HERMIA
   248	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
   249	HELENA
   250	O that my prayers could such affection move!
   251	HERMIA
   252	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
   253	HELENA
   254	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
   255	HERMIA
   256	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
   257	HELENA
   258	None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
   259	HERMIA
   260	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
   261	Lysander and myself will fly this place.
   262	Before the time I did Lysander see,
   263	Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
   264	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
   265	That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
   266	LYSANDER
   267	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
   268	To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
   269	Her silver visage in the watery glass,
   270	Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
   271	A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
   272	Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
   273	HERMIA
   274	And in the wood, where often you and I
   275	Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
   276	Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
   277	There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
   278	And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
   279	To seek new friends and stranger companies.
   280	Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
   281	And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
   282	Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
   283	From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
   284	LYSANDER
   285	I will, my Hermia.
   286	Exit HERMIA
   287	
   288	Helena, adieu:
   289	As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
   290	Exit
   291	
   292	HELENA
   293	How happy some o'er other some can be!
   294	Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
   295	But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
   296	He will not know what all but he do know:
   297	And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
   298	So I, admiring of his qualities:
   299	Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
   300	Love can transpose to form and dignity:
   301	Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
   302	And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
   303	Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
   304	Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
   305	And therefore is Love said to be a child,
   306	Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
   307	As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
   308	So the boy Love is perjured every where:
   309	For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
   310	He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
   311	And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
   312	So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
   313	I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
   314	Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
   315	Pursue her; and for this intelligence
   316	If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
   317	But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
   318	To have his sight thither and back again.
   319	Exit
